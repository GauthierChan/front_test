  ReactJS / NextJS - Take Home Test
  </b><br>
</p>

Welcome and thank you for taking the time to do the take-home test for our Founding Engineer (ReactJS/NextJS) position.

The assignment consists of letting you improve a basic codebase.
We've created for you a simple app to browse products given by a dummy API and where you can add these items in a cart.

The app is using the same libraries Sedeo is using (ReactJS/NextJS/TypeScript/Redux/MaterialUI), sometimes not entirely correctly, sometimes with an older version. The project is intentionally made to be corrected.


You are free to improve the app in any way you see fit. **The goal is not to provide you with a list of tasks, but to allow you to showcase the skills you think matters.**

Whether you think the app needs UX/UI fixes, tests, library updates, refactoring, AI-generated thumbnails from an item description, or 3D animations, feel free to implement your solutions. We are curious to see what you will do, and there are no wrong solutions.



There is no time requirements to the assessment but we think you should be able to produce enough material to review in at most 4 hours. This is up to you if you want do more or less.

If there were features/architecturing you wanted to implement but were not doable in a timely manner we're still curious to know your train of thoughts and how you would have done it. Simply add them in the readme at the end.

    - All changes have been pushed to your repo.
    - **Please message us on LinkedIn with a link to the new github repository and instructions on how to install / run the application.**

#### Here are some ideas if you don't know where to start


1) Is the website mobile-friendly? Does the codebase should be refactored to better handle responsive design?

2) Does the file/code architecture seems fine to you?

2) Is NextJS used to its full potential? Could some pages be statically generated?

3) How would you improve the Redux usage?

5) Are there some micro-interactions to implement to improve the UX?

6) Are there any tests to write?

7) Could there be some other usage of the dummy API (docs here: https://fakestoreapi.com)?


## Getting Started

1) Clone the project and open it in your favourite IDE

2) Run
  ```bash
npm install
```

3) Then run
  ```bash
npm run dev
```

4) The app will be available on localhost:1104
